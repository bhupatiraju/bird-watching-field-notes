# Bird Watching Field Notes

Repo for code and output from bird watching field notes. The compiled output is located [here](output/field_notes.md).

The full pipeline consists of the following:
1. Extract the text from the scanned images (not done here)
2. Standardize spelling and case (GPT API call)
3. Automatic match to an entry in eBird (eBird API call)
4. Manual processing of remaining entries, and
5. Final disambiguation, association of Scientific name, link to eBird

A few sample rows of the output is below:
